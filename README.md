Problem Definition & Motivation 
- [to change] Classical randomness systems are limited and can't replicate quantum uncertainity or interference effects
- We strive to utilize the unique properties of quantum computing through qiskit
- the game simulates quantum circuits to demonstrate how 

Technical Approach (Theory)
- Design a game leveraging the superposition entanglement mechanism provided by the qiskit library
- superposition -> allows a creative and quantum form of randomization
- entanglement -> allows 

Implementation quality
- Make clean, readable and functioning program

Result & Evaluation
- Collect histograms or other graphs of quantum vs classical runs
- Visualize how

Ideas:
- Multiplayer
- Quantum Generated maps 
- Superposition somehow
- Entanglement (must have due to team name)
- Measurement
