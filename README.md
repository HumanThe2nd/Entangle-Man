## Installation
If not already installed,
- Install Qiskit to run code on quantum hardware
```
pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime
```
- Install Pygame for game interface
```
pip install pygame
```


## Problem Definition & Motivation 
- Quantum computing is still unefficient and not commonly applicable in modern systems
- We strive to utilize the unique properties of quantum computing through qiskit to demonstrate its capabales
- To achieve this goal, we create an interactive game, visualizing the character

## Technical Approach (Theory)
Design a game leveraging quantum mechanism provided by the qiskit library
1. superposition: all walls are visible but are in a superposition of existence (some can be moved through)
2. entanglement: the ghosts (and or particles) have their fates entangled (eating one has a chance to eat others)
3. Noise: **only add if we have time** -> every time interval, a "noise" changes the state of the walls 

## Implementation quality
- Aiming for clean, readable and functioning program

## Result & Evaluation
- Collect histograms or other graphs of quantum vs classical runs
- Visualize the stats/noise and give a demo of the game

## Quantum Rigor & Insight
- Illustrate the connection between quantum properties with our interactive demo

## Reproducibility & Repo Quality
- Readme contains all details to run

## Impact & Creativity
- Educates users of quantum peroperties such as superposition and entanglement
- Built using quantum library
